# PyJump

An auto-scrolling 2D platformer similar to Geometry Dash.
I started work on this 8 days before I made the repo, but a bunch of my friends wanted to try it out, so I decided to create this repo to make it easily accessible.
This is not a finished product by any means, in fact it's barely a minimum viable product, but I hope you'll enjoy it nonetheless.
Fun fact: This is actually my class 12 CBSE project! I wanted to go out of my last year of school with a bang in my favourite subject!
Enjoy, and please share your feedback!

Python and arcade 3.0.0-dev29 are required to play.
